JWebSockets
===========

This is the code i've shown during my talk at #jab14 (http://www.jandbeyond.org) regarding "Realtime Joomla Websites"

It's a small demo of how it's possible to deal with Websockets in PHP and particularly in Joomla!.
It's build as a CLI application (cli/ws.php) that runs as a separate Websocket Server, and a demo component (com_ws) that 
interacts with the websockets server.
